# Eclairscript

**Eclairscript** is a high-level, statically typed programming language designed for a **stack-based VM**.
This repository contains the **Eclairscript compiler**, which translates human-readable Eclairscript code into bytecode that can be executed by the VM.

# Current Features

- Lexical analysis
- That's it lmao 🥀

## How to use?

`eclair filename.ecs`

Currently, running this command will display a list of tokens.  
In future versions, it will generate a compressed `.eclair` file containing bytecode that can be executed by the VM.

## EclairVM
EclairVM has its own [repository](https://github.com/ekler25/eclairvm) (give me star pls)
